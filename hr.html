            <p>Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. </p>
            <hr>
            <p>This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it</p>
            <hr>
            <p> A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create.</p>
